# Dice Game
1. This is a simple two-player dice game implemented in JavaScript.

# How to run the game
To run the game, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. There is play button on the page. You can start the game by clicking the play button.

# Functionality
The JavaScript function rollDice() generates two random numbers between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of two dice. The resulting numbers are used to determine the outcome of the game, and to display the corresponding dice images and the result of the game on the web page. The function is triggered both when the page is loaded and when it is about to be closed.


# Conclusion
