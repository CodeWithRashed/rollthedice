# Dice Game
1. This is a simple two-player dice game implemented in JavaScript.

# How to run the game
To run the game, simply open the HTML file in a web browser. The JavaScript code is embedded in the HTML file and will execute automatically.

# Functionality
The JavaScript function rollDice() generates two random numbers between 1 and 6, simulating the roll of two dice. The resulting numbers are used to determine the outcome of the game, and to display the corresponding dice images and the result of the game on the web page. The function is triggered both when the page is loaded and when it is about to be closed.


# Conclusion
This code was developed for fun as part of my learning journey in JavaScript and web development. It serves as a simple example of how to create a two-player dice game in JavaScript and can be used as a starting point for further exploration and learning.
